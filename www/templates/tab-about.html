  <h2>About</h2>
   <div style="padding: 30px;">
    <p>Macquarie University offers a free shuttle bus service around the Campus during semester. Simply hop on or off wherever you choose and use the service as much or as little as you like. </p>

    <p>The shuttle bus is a complimentary service for all staff, students and guests. It operates on Monday to Friday during semester from 4:00pm to 12.30am, meaning you can use the service to transport you to and from Buildings, the Hub, train station
                and student accommodation.</p>

    <p>The shuttle bus follows several routes and operates every 30 minutes so itâ€™s very easy to get where you need to go. Use this app, developed by Macquarie University PACE students, to view the live map and timetable of the shuttle bus.</p>
